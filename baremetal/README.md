# No OS ! For real hardcore hardware fanatics
Let's be clear, not using Windows is always a lot of fun and unix like OSes are serious stuff for your servers, your desktop
computer and everything in between. In the embedded world Windows is just a joke and fortunately nothing serious on the Pi
too, there's a laughable port of it but fortunately no one really cares.

If you've time (a lot of it) and you really want to get fancy on the Pi you can get a rid of linux too. Plan9 or RISCos are
cool but: if you're concerned about speed, you'd like to have a really lightweight system (really light..), you'd like to go
realtime, you want 0s boot time, you'd like to get a rid of each single library, you hate systemd or your mother tongue 
language is assembly. Well, you're in the right section of the site.

Here are few resources for real hardcore developers, tough guys (and girls) and extremists. When you really care about each
single bit flip or you're absolutely sure about your code and each single function running in your system.

- https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/ Baking Pi â€“ Operating Systems Development

  A good starting point, I did it once, it's a real pain and it takes a lot of time but it's even a lot of fun
- http://www.valvers.com/open-software/raspberry-pi/step01-bare-metal-programming-in-cpt1/<br>Bare Metal Programming in C Pt1

  Just a link to a bunch of resources, this site is really well done and contains a lot of stuff. Quite good intro with
  valuable tips on cross compiling. Are you planning to compile on bare metal hw ? no way, take cross compilation seriously.
- https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi Amazing github repository

  This guy uses the Pi with a rigorous approach of a serious electronic engineer, just like if you're in the 1950s and you need
  to keep up and have some work done with some real hardware. When you don't believe in the existence of a piece of software
  called "Operating System" (hey, what's that ??) this is probably your favorite resource. 
  Bunch of examples on each single part of the machine, a must read
