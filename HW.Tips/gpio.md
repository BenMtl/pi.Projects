# Python ad GPIO
`wiringpi` package is not required if you'd like to use just python and your program, it might be useful on command line
but it's not necessary if you want to use only your program, it's not a python dependency.

### RPi.GPIO
if you have `RPi.GPIO` in your package repository (raspbian,arch,gentoo,...) just install this and you're set,
if you don't have it use `pip`
```
pip install RPi.GPIO
```
