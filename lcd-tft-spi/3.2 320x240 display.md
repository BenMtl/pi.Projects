# Setup
```
apt install libts-bin
apt install evtest
export TSLIB_TSDEVICE=/dev/input/event0
export TSLIB_FBDEVICE=/dev/fb1
ts_calibrate
cat /etc/pointercal 
ts_test
# modprobe ads7846
```

# Raspberry configuration
Use overlays to get it working on I2C after boot, you cannot see coloured screen and initial boot sequence but the
screen is usable after I2C module loading
### /boot/config.txt
I2C setup (touch) and SPI (display), these two overlays are both working
```
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=spi=on
#dtoverlay=tft9341:rotate=270
dtoverlay=waveshare32b:rotate=90
```

### /boot/cmdline.txt
`fbcon` parameters are fine to set a proper screen font
```
# `fbcon=` parameters are what you need to get it working
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait fbcon=map:10 fbcon=font:VGA8x8 logo.nologo
```

### /etc/udev/rules.d/95-ads7846.rules
Link `event?` touchscreen to `touchscreen` too, it's easier if some software is looking for `/dev/input/touchscreen` instead of a classic `/dev/input/event0` (or whatever `event?` it will map to)
```
SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", ATTRS{name}=="ADS7846 Touchscreen", SYMLINK+="input/touchscreen"
```
