# Common LCD Monitor transformed in a RPi workstation
This project aims to recover an old, refurbished and outdated LCD display from HP in order to optionally use it with a Raspberry Pi (B,v1), I don't have a laptop and for a stationary/occasional usage at home this could be a nice solution. I don't need to use it in mobility so batteries are not an issue because AC power is a viable solution. For few basic tasks like editing files and compiling this is a good platform even without X, I occasionally use X with VNC to access remote environments as well. Monitor is not strictly dedicated to the Pi and keeps its original behavior, when the Pi is necessary it's usable just by connecting it through the HDMI cable and the dedicated power switch. The Rasbperry is embedded inside the monitor in some empty space HP has gently left inside it, after some mixed usage I didn't noticed overheating nor other strange symptoms.

Now this is usable as a common secondary monitor (for an external pc) or as a RPi workstation. Just connect the cable, turn on the switch and you're set.
